# Software-Component-Design-Drawing-Pad

This project presents the design and implementation of
a modular drawing pad application, with an emphasis
on component-based architecture and efficient memory
management. The application supports core drawing functionalities, including the creation of basic geometric shapes,
straight lines, and freehand sketches. Additional features
include a “clear all” function, an eraser tool for partial
or complete removal of drawings, and a shape-filling capability with multiple color options. A save-and-load
mechanism is implemented to allow persistent storage and
retrieval of user-created content. The application is developed using the EasyX graphics library, which serves
as the rendering engine for translating data structures
into interactive visual components. The design prioritizes structured component interactions, effective use of
pointers, and careful selection of data structures to ensure
efficient performance and prevent memory leaks. Special
attention is given to the separation of preview rendering
from committed drawings, maintaining both responsiveness and stability during user interaction. Overall, the
project demonstrates a lightweight, modular, and maintainable architecture, enabling easy extension for future
enhancements and providing a foundation for scalable
graphical applications with robust memory management
and clean design principles.
